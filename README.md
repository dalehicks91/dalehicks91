- 👋 Hi, I’m @dalehicks91
- 👀 I’m interested in educating myself on networking, programming (in Python to start), and pentesting and cybersecurity. Currently an industrial refrigeration
and chiller technician and am looking to make a move into the IT industry. My personal devices were compromised this past summer and it dawned on me that I 
need to get with the times and learn how compueters and networks function.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use the linux terminal and the variations of shells and am looking to get my networking certifications.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me learn once I start to get my feet wet, but as of now it's safe to say I'm useless
on almost all topics unless you need tech support on your datacenter cooling systems.
